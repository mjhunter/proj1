Design Challenges: Keeping the GameOfLifeModel and the GameOfLifeDrawer seperate
presented most of the design challenges.  Limiting the number of ways to interact
with Square and Board using closures helped to ensure the modularity of the code.
Outside of that, however, I didn't see many difficulties in the project, once I 
became more familiar with javascript and how the file systems worked.
